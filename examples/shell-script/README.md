# Instructions

Run the following command:

```bash
watch-files-changes -d "example.sh" -c "./example.sh"
```

`-d "example.sh"` -> let's just look at the changes in the example.sh file

`-c "./example.sh"` -> when making changes to the `example.sh` file, the `./example.sh` command will be executed
