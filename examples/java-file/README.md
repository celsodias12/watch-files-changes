# Instructions

## Example 1

Run the following command:

```bash
watch-files-changes -d "Main.java" -c "javac Main.java" -a "sleep 0.2 && java Main"
```

`-d "Main.java"` -> will only watch changes to the `Main.java` file

`-c "javac Main.java"` -> when detecting any change it will run the command `javac Main.java`

`-a "sleep 0.2 && java Main"` -> after executing the command `javac Main.java` in sequence, the command `sleep 0.2 && java Main` will be executed. The `sleep` command is necessary as the `javac Main.java` command can take a while to run to generate the Main.class file. After starting the execution of the `javac Main.java` command and waiting 0.2 seconds, then the `java Main` command will be executed, which will execute the Main.class file generated by the `javac Main.java` command

## Example 2

Run the following command:

```bash
watch-files-changes -d "." -i "Main.class" -c "javac Main.java" -a "sleep 0.2 && java Main"
```

`-d "."` -> will watch all changes of the current directory

`-i "Main.class"` -> will ignore changes to the `Main.class` file in the current directory

`-c "javac Main.java"` -> when detecting any change it will run the command `javac Main.java`

`-a "sleep 0.2 && java Main"` -> after executing the command `javac Main.java` in sequence, the command `sleep 0.2 && java Main` will be executed. The `sleep` command is necessary as the `javac Main.java` command can take a while to run to generate the Main.class file. After starting the execution of the `javac Main.java` command and waiting 0.2 seconds, then the `java Main` command will be executed, which will execute the Main.class file generated by the `javac Main.java` command
